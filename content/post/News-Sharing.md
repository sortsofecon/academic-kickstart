Huaxin Wanglu has been studying labor mobility and child development in China with Dr. Octasiano Valerio Mendoza and Dr. Flavio Comim at the IQS School of Management. She is a valuable member of the Social Economics and Ethics (SEE) Research Group and has contributed to the H2020-CHINEQUALJUSTICE and EIN2019-102931 funded by the European Commission and Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, respectively. Her research provides important insights and policy implications to understanding migration decisions based on employment structural changes and also how parent’s values and perceptions affect their children’s academic development. Her research stay at the Heidelberg Institute of Global Health under the supervision of Dr. Simiao Chen will enable her to expand her studies from a health perspective.
