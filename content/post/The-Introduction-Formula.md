Have just found a really good post written by Prof. Keith Head in his Blog at http://blogs.ubc.ca/khead/research/research-advice/formula:

> 1. Hook: Attract the reader’s interest by telling them that this paper relates to something interesting. What makes a topic interesting? Some combination of the following attributes makes Y something worth looking at.
> - Y matters: When Y rises or falls, people are hurt or helped.
> - Y is puzzling: it defies easy explanation.
> - Y is controversial: some argue one thing while other say another.
> - Y is big (like the service sector) or common (like traffic jams).
> 2. Question: Tell the reader what this paper actually does. Think of this as the point in a trial where having detailed the crime, you now identify a perpetrator and promise to provide a persuasive case. The reader should have an idea of a clean research question that will have a more or less satisfactory answer by the end of the paper. Examples follow below. The question may take two paragraphs. At the end of the first (2nd paragraph of the paper) or possibly beginning of the second (3rd paragraph overall) you should have the “This paper addresses the question” sentence.
> 3. Antecedents: Identify the prior work that is critical for understanding the contribution this paper will make. The key mistake to avoid here are discussing papers that are not essential parts of the intellectual narrative leading up to your own paper. Give credit where due but establish, in a non-insulting way, that the prior work is incomplete or otherwise deficient in some important way.
> 4. Value-Added: Describe approximately 3 contributions this paper will make relative to the antecedents. This paragraph might be the most important one for convincing referees not to reject your paper. A big difference between it and the earlier “question” paragraph is that the contributions should make sense only in light of prior work whereas the basic research question of the paper should be understandable simply in terms of knowing the topic (from the hook paragraph). John suggests that “Antecedents” and “Value-added” may be intertwined. They may also take up to 3 paragraphs.
> 5. Road-map: Outline the organization of the paper. Avoid writing an outline so generic that it could apply to any paper (“the next section is the middle of the paper and then we have the end”). Instead customize the road map to the project and possibly mention pivotal “landmarks” (problems, solutions, results…) that will be seen along the way. But keep this short because many readers will now be eager to get to the heart of the paper.

A good introduction is deemed the most impressive. An attractive, well-written one is greatly helpful to leave a good "first impression" on the referee. Last time I quite enjoyed reading a paper is that I felt I had been guided very informatively and smoonthly through the introduction to the topic (that is, Graham, C., Zhou, S., & Zhang, J., 2017). Even though afterwards I think its approach and model aren't as "amazing" as does its introduction, I can remember it very well. The authors have wonderful paper-sales skills which are deserved to be learned. A good introduction could contribute to the acceptance, and we shall pay more attention to refine it.
