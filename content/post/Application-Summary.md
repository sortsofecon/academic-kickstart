The most long-lasting challenge that I have ever had has eventually come to an end this month - I get a PhD fellowship now! 

Lots of Bravo!

Since last June when I declined the offer of admission to the Data Engineering master program at Jacobs Univ, I began seeking for PhD opportunities till this April.  Last August, I had my first interview with a Marie-Curie supervisory panel that consists of 4 members. This was a surprise to me since it's the first PhD position I applied to, yet I was consequently listed as alternate candidate to that project. Afterwards, In Sept, I declined the acceptance of the Univ of Ottawa and the Univ of Groningen, respectively. I firmly determined to do a PhD instead of taking a second master in any form. In Oct or Nov, I started to think of doing a PhD via CSC channel and so I applied to the VU Amsterdam. 

Most of my applications were sent out from Dec 2019 to Feb 2020 after my GRE score was refreshed. The first admission letter I got was issued by the VU Amsterdam in mid Jan, while since that PhD program is via CSC channel, their acceptance is contingent on successfully receiving a CSC Scholarship. Compared to other sorts of PhD scholarships, the success rates of CSC are relatively higher as the VU has an agreement with the funding agency that 25 places each year are secured. However, CSC sets up certain thresholds to narrow the eligibility of candidates. For my case, I have to be an in-service staff who has been employed by an enterprise to be eligible for the application. I eventually gave it up because of the troublesome documentation.

Then in March, I got accepted to a PhD program in the US. While I was requested to present a test score before any funding decision can be reached. Due to the outbreak of Coronavirus keeping everyone from attending an exam, I cannot meet this requirement. Without any financial aids, doing PhD in the US is beyond my capacity.

As time goes by, I was admitted to another PhD program at Nova SBE in April. To be honest, it is one of my favourite business schools in Europe since I love Lisbon pretty much! The size and internationalization of its faculty attracted me to apply, but due to the Portuguese agency changed its funding rules, no scholarship can be granted to any candidate except for a 90% tuition waive this year. I am okay with this result since there are alternative opportunities for candidates to have funding. Yet I had to acknowledge to myself that it isn't a nice ending pose - in countries like Germany where universities do not charge any tuition fees, there is a high possibility for me to be admitted to a more reputed PhD program if I do self-fund. 

My referee told me that as the global economy had been entering a recession, I had better accept one of them. While in the interim, I decided to give myself one last try. I sent out my application to a research group based in Barcelona before I finally confirmed my attendance to Nova. Though I feel sorry to Nova, money matters. Being an adult who is aged over 25, relying on parents' financial support for study sounds indeed stressful to me. 

When writting down the timeline here, I am quite proud of my perseverance in the face of overwhelming unpleasant results since last year - either rejection or no funding. Hopefully everythiny goes well and I can receive my work authorization soon.
