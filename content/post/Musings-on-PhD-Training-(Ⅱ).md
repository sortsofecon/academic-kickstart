Okay, let me take a break from my work and start writing some nonsense. I call the traditionally-mentored PhD “project-based”, which means their dissertations are typically affiliated to a certain research project that is granted to their supervisors (investigators). Previously, I mentioned some aspects that a structural program may favor despite my doubts about my friend, while a project-based training system also has its pros and cons. I will first discuss the cons. 

Obviously, when you engage in a funded project and is hired by your supervisor, you typically cannot maximize your research freedom. A fixed framework is already set there, so if you don’t really like it, the next few years will be horrible. When we send the applications, we presumably give tacit consent that we think the project intrigues us. Ideally, we should never apply for any projects that we are not indeed interested in. But realistically, we often do so because we are the disciple of the law of large numbers. I also did it a few times – I applied for some positions in agricultural and/or environmental economics just because the grade of my EE course is decent, and their admission thresholds are relatively slightly lower. Last time, I met a guy who was doing his PhD in TUM and he made some complaints about the dim prospect of that sub-field his project pertains to. I thought over field prospects several times and it is ashamed that I still know nothing about how to identify it. However, really few people can study data science right before its times arrived and even deep learning has its dim period. Anyhow, we always can shift across sub-fields – many people have proven it, so the preoccupation for us is to get the first credit done. And at this stage, “interest is the best teacher” would never be a lie. This is also somehow my choice. I chose the project that I thought I were most likely to handle well because of the familiarity and interest.

Let me get back to the topic of this post. Compared to the PhD life in structural programs, a project-based PhD has to adapt to her workflows faster and kick off the work as soon as possible. Two cons I have found so far. First, since you do not have specialized courses, you have fewer opportunities to meet peers. Information exchange might be a problem then. Sometimes, I hope to have a group discussion where I can express my silly confusions that I do not want to bother my advisor, but colleagues I know do not specialize in any fields in close proximity to mine and I cannot find someone who might have interest and knowledge to discuss them with me. Second, you will have a more stringent deadline. Usually, funded projects should submit reports to the funding agency about the progress has been made so far, as a contributor, we will have to ensure our work doesn’t lag behind. Some structural programs provide additional funding to students who postpone graduation, but this is often not very feasible if you are a project-based PhD. That is to say, you also have a more stringency graduation deadline as well. I think these might be two major limitations of the traditional-mentoring system. However, as you are hired by the project, sometimes if you have a very “mean” supervisor, this drawback will definitely outperform anything else since you supposedly cannot change your "boss" if you don't want to quit. If you are funded by a structural program, either receiving scholarships or earning from doing TA or RA, normally you can.

In contrast to the aforementioned, I think there are three pros of it. First, you won’t waste much time in wavering between various topics without a determination. This is quite important to me since I am a person who always created many different characters in role-playing games and then spent tremendous time in newbie towns. Second, your work will be guided under a proven feasible framework. In social science, this might not have a big difference, but for people who major in natural science or engineering, an unmature tentative project sometimes can ruin their life. I have heard such stories from my friends who are doing their PhDs in Asia and others who are funded by CSC (a government-level scholarship of China). Some of them spent two years in exploring their projects, while having gotten stuck in the halfway and receive no help from their supervisors simply because no one understands it. Usually, if a project can receive funding from a good agency, it would rarely be “no-explorative”. Third, you are more deeply involved in your sub-community. This may also be true for those who are hired as RA in structural programs and less true for TA (but still true, as long as you have a formal work outside your own dissertations). Regular contacts between the investigators, members in your groups, and you will help on integration. I had almost zero contact with the advisor of my master thesis, so when I made my PhD application, I carefully evaluated the possibility of faculty-student contact of each position. As said before, it is helpful to identify the necessary knowledge and skills we need for our research as early as possible. A project-based PhD may offer certain advantages in this sense so that students can more early and smoothly locate their missing skillsets. However, I have to admit that probably how the Netherlands manages PhD is the best solution. Or a structural training plus RA (the US way, but also varies between programs in the US since some suffer funding budget have very limited RA opportunities that even cannot be guaranteed for third and fourth-year PhDs). 

By the way, nowadays, many project-based PhDs are also embedded in a program (but probably not structural) even not always the case (I learn that some have doctoral schools but do not have targeted programs for them because their majors are minority in the schools). For example, my program doesn’t set any specialized courses prior to the dissertation stage, but we are monitored and organized by the program with regular seminars, workshops and a few elective courses focusing on transferable skills. In this way, our timing would not be disturbed by regular lectures, so we can be fully dedicated to our research. Although I feel it’s a pity that I cannot meet econometrician or applied guys (LOL), the overall vibe makes me feel comfortable.
