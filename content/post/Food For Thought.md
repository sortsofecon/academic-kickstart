Having just read an insightful article published by the Journal of Economic Perspective, i.e. Conley, J. P., & Ã–nder, A. S. (2014), which is instructive to me. They explore the publication records of PhD graduates in economics from the US and Canadian academic institutions to study the relationships between programs of various ranks and the research outcomes of their students in the six year after graduation. One of their intriguing findings is that although top departments like Harvard or MIT are better at training top students, the middle- or lower-level students underperformed their counterparts of equal percentile ranks at certain lower-ranked departments. This story sound like an old saying: better be the head of a dog than the tail of a lion. While, of course, the survival rates of PhD student at lower-ranked departments in regard to whatever completing their PhD or gaining tenure are much lower. The researchers discuss why it would happen to top-ranked departments that even they are dominant in selecting the best candidates, they still produce a considerable cohort of students who fail to meet a tenure standard and is in fact zero in most. 

This paper tells both good news and bad news. The good news is that non-top departments still produce successful new economists, while even to those who in a top-ranked program, the likelihood for them to ultimately be a tenured professor is still not optimistic.
