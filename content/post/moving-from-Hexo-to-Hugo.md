It has been almost two years since I built up my first own website. In May 2018, I deployed a small site powered by Hexo after learning the use of Git and Github from an online course. Though I cannot recall the procedure in details, I was impressed by a great deal of unexpected errors occurring accidentally. I still remember that after extensive exploration in Google, a few of them cannot be solved by any answer posted. And it was quite inconvenient to change a theme since some elements that had been enabled in one theme was very likely to be exclusively effective in that one or old ones. Changing a theme means I had to re-customize almost everything in my files to make their format conform to the new one. After adopting an updated new theme, the About page can never work correctly. I tried all the given solutions but failed to figure it out. Therefore, I eventually stopped using it. Recently, when I looked at the website of my prospective supervisor, I learned about Hugo. I have to say this framework seems much much easier than the Hexo (*probably Hexo improved a lot now*). And the theme, Academic, created by MIT is quite nice. The syntax in files is very user-friendly, providing rather detailed introduction and explanations. Customization is also easy. MIT gives instruction patiently and thoroughly. It's also nice to know that Hugo supports R Markdown and Jupyter Notebook. Despite both of them by-now irrelevant to writing this Blog, I am supposed to use them in the future as for sharing my work along with the doctoral studies. I am indeed looking forward to enriching this Blog. Hopefully, I can receive a PhD offer soon. Finger crossed!
