It has been almost two years since I built up my first own website. In May 2018, I deployed a small site powered by Hexo after learning the use of Git and Github from an online course. Though I cannot recall the procedure in details, I was impressed by a great deal of unexpected errors occurring occasionally. I still remember that after extensive explorations in Google, a few of them still cannot be solved by any answers posted. And it was quite inconvenient to change a theme since certain elements enabled in one theme was very likely to be exclusively effective in only that one or old ones. Changing a theme means I had to re-customize almost everything in my files to make their formats fit the new one. After adopting an updated new theme, the About page can never work correctly. I tried all the given solutions but failed to figure it out. Thus, I stopped using it. Recently, when I looked at the websites of some researchers, I have learned about Hugo. I have to say this framework seems much much tidier than the Hexo (*probably Hexo improves a lot now*). And the theme, Academic, created by MIT is quite nice. The syntax in files is very user-friendly, providing rather detailed introduction and explanations. Customization is also easy. MIT gives instruction patiently and thoroughly. It's nice to know that Hugo supports R Markdown and Jupyter Notebook. Despite both of them by-now irrelevant to writing this Blog, I am supposed to use them in the future as for sharing my PhD work. I am indeed looking forward to enriching this website! Hopefully, I can receive a PhD offer soon. Fingers crossed.
