Since last December, I have gradually applied to 12 doctoral programs. I understand that my background isn't very competitive, so I even consider the possibility of self-financing if the program deserves. This Jan, I received an acceptance letter conditional on the grant of CSC Scholarship. I was quite excited even though this is not an offer since the university is quite good at economics and the research fields of the prospective (co-)supervisors highly match up with my interests. Also, via e-mail communication, the supervisor seems very nice. I am satisfied with this result and even decided to self-finance my studies in the first year if I fail in the scholarship competition. While recently the supervisor tend to not reply to my e-mails. Till now, it has been over a week since I sent him my new revised proposal. He usually responded to my e-mail within two days. I feel like he has been reluctant to further proceed with my CSC application, yet our communications were overall quite good. No reason I can figure out regarding this change. And moreover, since late Jan, I have received seven rejection letters from doctoral programs. Today it's from the UB. Their program doesn't have any funding. Students who are admitted should apply for scholarships from other sources. I thought it should be relatively easier than other programs where issuing full scholarship. However, I still failed at the application and I just found on their current and past students' lists, no Chinese can be seen. Now, never have I been more concerned. Three days ago, I was informed by the SUNY-Buffalo of providing the committee with a few additional information. The assistant told me that they reviewed the application again and again during the whole of Feb and so it doesn't mean that my materials have just been reviewed but seriously considered. I do hope to hear a piece of good news from them in early March. However, after a series of blows, I understand that it's very likely just another hit.
