Since last December, I have gradually applied to 12 doctoral programs based in the USA, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Austria and Italy. I understand that my background isn't very competitive, so I even consider the possibility of self-financing if the program deserves. This Jan, I received an offer letter conditional on the grant of CSC. I was quite excited even though this is not a full scholarship since the university is quite good at economics and the research fields of the prospective (co-)supervisors highly match up with my interests. Also, via e-mail communication, the supervisor seems very nice. I am satisfied with this result and even decided to self-finance my studies in the first year if I fail in the CSC scholarship competition. While due to the outbreak of the coronavirus, CSC decided to postpone its online application from 10 March to 10 April and then the supervisor tend to not reply to my e-mails. Till now, it has been over a week since I sent him my new revised proposal. He usually responded to my e-mail within two days. I feel like he has been reluctant to further proceed with my CSC application now, yet our communications were overall quite good. No reason I can figure out regarding this change. And moreover, since Feb, I have been received seven decisions of rejection on my applications in total. Today it's from the UB. Their program doesn't provide any funding, students who are admitted should apply for scholarships from other sources. I thought it should be relatively easier than other programs where issuing full scholarship. However, I still failed at the application and I just found on their current and past students' lists, no Chinese can be seen. Now, I indeed beg for admission. Three days ago, I was informed by the SUNY-Buffalo of providing the committee with a few additional information. The assistant told me that they reviewed the application again and again during the whole of Feb and so it doesn't mean that my materials have just been reviewed but seriously considered. I do hope to hear good news from them in early March. However, now I am really afraid of having any hope. 

How can I let them trust that my learning ability is indeed good and my learning outcome from my postgraduate program is not as bad as my transcript represents??? I do not have any prior knowledge of even elementary econometrics but I passed the advanced econometrics with an average grade and at the first attempt! My peers whose background is similar to me all either just achieved a sufficient grade or failed at the first attempt. The economics faculty of Konstanz admits at more than 50% of students who have just a little prior knowledge in economics and set extreme high-level study requirements, particularly the compulsory ones in the first semester. Lots of my classmates quitted the program in the first and second semesters. When I exchanged to another university based in the UK, I do feel their coursework is super easy compared to what Konstanz taught and required. The grade of my master thesis also results in huge concerns of others over my research potentials. While I can never explain to them that my supervisor was out of the office for around two months and he even didn't have any postdoc or doctoral students who can help me check the direction of my thesis. And he even misled me. I asked him about whether it's proper to develop the model on the foundation of the self-selection and was replied a denial. Then I consulted maybe I should think of using game theory? He answered 'Yes'. After I finalized my theoretical framework, he doubted why I used that one, not the model of self-selection. And he told me that it was nice if I can compute the specific gender quota that should be introduced in the context. After writing the thesis for over two months, I realized that the datasets themselves cannot support such a computation since the experiments per se do not introduce a mechanism of gender quotas. While I did not have time and funds to re-collect data via experiments as the deadline was ticking. If I know he would visit the USA for such a long time, I would not opt for a thesis under his supervision. While everything is too late to regret. This year I learned from one of my colleagues that another classmate who failed at microeconomics and econometrics two times has kicked off his doctoral studies. Life is so surprising! But no surprise to me.
