Recently, one of my friends discussed with me about her application for PhD in economics this year. As expected, the 2021 intake has been extremely competitive since the economic downturn worldwide affected by the Covid. However, even without the Covid, the admission to PhD programs in economics already tends to get harder and harder year by year because of the supply-demand imbalance. When I was DIY my application in the second half of 2019, I regretted several times that I hadn’t made my application one year earlier, otherwise, my success rate was very likely to be higher. The outbreak of Covid undoubtfully exacerbates the competition. Less funded projects and places in the programs. In fact, around half of my application time was in the shadow of Covid. I fully understand how hard it is.

When I was told by my friend that some people who applied for this fall too had decided to postpone their admission and instead, attended a second master program, because of no funding support this year, I was a bit surprised. I don’t agree that the competition situation will be better in 2022, even though our life could fully return to normal in the coming year. Economic conditions in many countries may have to take at least 3-5 years to recover. The decline of mid-range job opportunities in various countries will continuously push young graduates to resort to further education. As a result, the PhD application won’t be easier in 2022 than in 2021, and the funding opportunities, considering the growing marginal difficulty, even become slightly better than the present, the overall situation won’t have much change, unless the number of applicants would be significantly less. Think about “economics”, the chance for this to happen is almost 0. 

Following my nonsense worry about their decisions, I turn to think of the future employment we have to face. Based on my observation, PhD’s placements are quite volatile even within the programs. As I am still a first-year PhD student, I don’t know much about the job market, but I understand that there are two big things. First and foremost is the program’s reputation, or say, faculty's connections. Higher-ranked departments tend to place their students better not merely because their students are on average more capable but also of their networks and reputation. Another thing is of course the publication or, let’s say, the job market paper. What I am concerned is, as the admission and particularly the fellowship tends to be terribly demanding, many applicants will have to target relatively lower-ranked programs and have very limited choices between funded positions. Last year, I also learned that some people were brainstorming between yielding to funding and their research interests.

Besides these concerns, my friend and I also talked about the PhD training system. Usually, PhD students in the EU are hired as a researcher and integrated into a research group where the projects are managed. This is the traditional way to train a PhD student here. However, more and more universities are shifting towards structural programs. This is identical to the training system in the US. In the latter case, students would not bond with any research projects at the initial stage and often, they will have an assigned supervisor at the end of the first year. My friend said that she wished to join a structural program (combined with 1 to 2-year master studies as if MRes) because she thought herself not well-prepared to jump in research in the first year. 

Specialized courses and a systematic review are what she needs to underpin her research abilities. I had the same thoughts just one year before as she has. I counted many advantages of structural programs and sent lots of applications, although I become a member of the former. However, now I feel very thankful for this result. I was quite unconfident as she is regarding whatever my coding skills, econometrics, scientific writing, etc. It is very reasonable for people like me to think that we need more courses and "buffer" time. Research is a new world. Fear, worry and pressure are common in the course of adaption to it. But (we already have an MSc) does one more course-taught year indeed make sense and can effectively improve our research abilities? If it does, why we didn’t acquire sufficient skills from our last program to be capable of doing research right now? 

Our master program is quite research-oriented and many of us have gaps in background, so we passed the exams quite arduously. After our graduation, we do not think we really master what we have been taught. But as we have learned it once, we believe that we can perform much better if we learn it again. This is why my friend and I (used to) prefer a structural program. But guess, if we attend a course in fall 2021 and start a relevant topic in fall 2022, to which extent we will still remember it? Will we need to learn it a third time? Does a perfect mathematical proof done in the exam proves that we are able to apply it practically in our research right away? Will PhD courses offered by a certain program cover all the knowledge we need to know for our research?

As far as I think, we can never be allegedly “well-prepared”. We are always short of certain knowledge or skills, but we cannot rely on teaching forever. Recalling that I taught myself over 1/2 of the courses throughout my bachelor and master programs, our urges are rather to identify what are the necessary knowledge and skills that we need for the research of interest? It’s not just an advanced microeconomics or econometrics, but something more specific and related. However, you can never know ex ante. A solid foundation is absolutely preferred, but there is no “solid enough”. I believe we already have required knowledge and self-learning abilities, while the next turn should be to identify the gaps not only in scholarship but also in our brain. When we find them, self-study and corresponding courses would never be too late, particularly if we find them earlier.
