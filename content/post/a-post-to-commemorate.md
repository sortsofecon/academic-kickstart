Doing a phd is a tough decision. Applying for a phd position is quite tough as well. When I began with my postgraduate study at the Univ of Konstanz, phd was never a serious option to me since I never got exposed to economic research and didn't have a clear idea of how it works. Even though from the very first day, the program director propagandized doing a phd in a series of sessions. Many students I met in the program had thought over doing a phd but was scared off facing the unexpected difficulties of the advanced economics courses, including my friend. The very few of them remained their ideas. For me, during that time, it was always a possible but not first choice since after suffering from the first semester, I overly understood that my background was quite disadvantaged. While, this idea was rooted in my mind though.

I was forced to give up this idea after receiving the grade of my thesis and then turned to thinking of doing a second master in data science. I received the acceptance from a few programs, for example, at Jacobs University and the University of Ottawa. However, taking a job in industry changed my idea. I realized that it was very likely that I can only find a similar position without a radical change since master programs in data science are often bootcamps if they do not require a strong background in computer science (which I am ineligible). Although data scientist is extremely popular, just a small cohort of them are indeed doing things in line with what I think. Someone living in Silicon Valley shared info with me that such positions often are only offered to phd. Graduates from data science most often take jobs akin to business analysts (what I did).

Before the universal open call for 2020 intake, I applied to over a hundred employment-based phd positions and was invited for interviews for a dozen times. Several of them put me on their waiting list as an alternate candidate including a Marie-Curie project, but none of them eventually accepted me. I understand that compared to others who worked as a research assistant, I am short in hands-on experience in research and the grades awarded by the Univ of Konstanz are not competitive. While I refreshed my GRE score, I got sick just before the exam and didn't perform very well in the test. Then there was an outbreak of COVID-19. As a response, all the testing agencies canceled the exams in China. In Dec 2019, I sifted through numerous universities in Europe and the USA, and gradually wrote up an application list. My last application was sent in mid-March and there are 14 programs in total I have applied to. At 1 a.m. on 8th April, I was surprisingly informed by Nova SBE that I had been admitted to their PhD program. It wasn't the first one who accepted me, but it was the first one in Europe. I already decided to give up the offer from another university in the USA that time due to the pandemic. Right now there is only one application pending and I confirmed that I would attend Nova. Lisbon left me an excellent impression in 2017 when I traveled around southern Europe and that's why I applied to Nova. Hopefully, I will take a good time as well in the next four years. Congratulations! (If Nova can offer me a full scholarship, not just tuition waiver, it will be a perfect ending pose for my long-lasting phd application.LOL)
