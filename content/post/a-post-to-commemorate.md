Doing a phd is a tough decision. Applying for a phd position is quite tough as well. When I began with my postgraduate study at the Univ of Konstanz, phd was never a serious option to me since I never got exposed to economic research and didn't have a clear idea of how it works. Even though from the very first day, the program director propagandized doing a phd in a series of sessions. Many students I met in the program had thought over doing a phd but was scared off facing the unexpected difficulties of the advanced economics courses, including my friend. The very few of them remained their ideas. For me, during that time, it was always a possible but not first choice since after suffering from the first semester, I overly understood that my background was quite disadvantaged. While, this idea was rooted in my mind though.

I was forced to give up this idea after receiving the grade of my thesis and then turned to thinking of doing a second master in data science. I received the acceptance from a few programs, for example, at Jacobs University and the University of Ottawa. However, taking a job in industry changed my idea. I realized that it was very likely that I can only find a similar position without a radical change since master programs in data science are often bootcamps if they do not require a strong background in computer science (which I am ineligible). Although data scientist is extremely popular, just a small cohort of them are indeed doing things in line with what I think. Someone living in Silicon Valley shared info with me that such positions often are only offered to phd. Graduates from data science most often take jobs akin to business analysts (what I did).
