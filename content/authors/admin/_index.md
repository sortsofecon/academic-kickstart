I am a PhD student at Universitat Ramon Llull (Barcelona). I was born in Shanghai and moved to Europe since 2016. I am now working on a MSCA-funded project with a focus on examining development traps in China. My current research agenda gazes at migration, human capital, capabilities approach and well-being. Cruising around the world and pushing the frontiers of knowledge are the coolest things I can imagine. Cheers!
