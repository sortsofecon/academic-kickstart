Hi, there! I am Huaxin, a PhD student in development economics. I was born in Shanghai and moved to Europe since 2016. I graduated with an MSc degree and will kick off my doctoral studies soon. I am so pleased to engage in cutting-edge research and teaching activities. Besides study, I have visited 17 countries in Europe and Asia till now. Cruising around the world and pushing the frontiers of knowledge are the coolest things I can imagine.
